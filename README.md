SDDM theme with Apple TV Aerial videos

### Dependencies

It is necessary to have the Phonon GStreamer backend for qt5, GStreamer ffmpeg Plugin and GStreamer Plugins Good
- For Arch linux : `pacman -S gst-libav phonon-qt5-gstreamer gst-plugins-good qt5-quickcontrols qt5-graphicaleffects qt5-multimedia`
- For Gentoo : these settings allowed me to make the theme work

    * `media-libs/gst-plugins-good`
    * `USE="alsa gstreamer qml widgets" dev-qt/qtmultimedia`
    * `USE="widgets" dev-qt/qtquickcontrols`
    * `dev-qt/qtgraphicaleffects`
    * `USE="gstreamer" media-libs/phonon`
    * `media-plugins/gst-plugins-openh264` (optional for video)
    * `media-plugins/gst-plugins-libde265` (optional for video)

 - For Kubuntu: `apt install gstreamer1.0-libav phonon4qt5-backend-gstreamer gstreamer1.0-plugins-good qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects qml-module-qtmultimedia qt5-default`

Havent tryed for other distros...

### Installation

Simply clone the repository and copy it to `/usr/share/sddm/themes/` like this:
```
git clone git@github.com:3ximus/aerial-sddm-theme.git
mv aerial-sddm-theme /usr/share/sddm/themes
```
*Note that super user priviledges are needed to move files into that directory.*

The theme can be tested by running `sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme <path-to-this-repository>`

### Other notes

This theme streams the HD videos so a good internet connection is necessary.
If there is no active connection or the video can't be played the background will fallback to the image background.jpg

If you wish to play local videos files just use the following command to generate the playlist-file (playlist_day.m3u or playlist_night.m3u) from a directory containing the videos:

`find <path-to-your-directory> -maxdepth 1 -type f > <playlist-file>`

If you would like to use the same videos but offline, simply download them using your shell, e.g. :

```
while read -r link; do
    wget "$link"
done < playlist_file
```

### Changing settings in `theme.conf.user`

You can change a few settings in this file
- `day_time_start` and `day_time_end` - set your day start/end time
- `background_img_day` and `background_img_night` - default background day/night image
- `background_vid_day` and `background_vid_night` - video playlists
- `displayFont` - font
- `showLoginButton` - if set to false will hide the login button
- `showClearPasswordButton` - if set to false will hide the clear password button that appears when text is inputed
- `passwordLeftMargin` and `usernameLeftMargin` - set margin between input boxes and labels, some fonts are messy and allows fixing of overlap
- `relativePositionX` and `relativePositionY` - position the login text box and clock
- `showTopBar` - if set to false will hide the wm/keyboard top bar

Example config (not the same as the screenshots):

```
[General]
background_vid_day=playlist_day.m3u
background_vid_night=playlist_night.m3u
displayFont="Misc Fixed"
showLoginButton=false
passwordLeftMargin=15
usernameLeftMargin=15
showTopBar=true
```
